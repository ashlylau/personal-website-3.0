Small-scale businesses such as Singapore's food hawkers are particularly vulnerable as not everyone in that community can immediately adapt their business models to benefit from food delivery apps. To help food stall owners alleviate their current cash-tight situation, this platform allows community members to purchase credit for future use, pre-paying small businesses via existing platforms like PayLah!. Whilst Kopi-19 addresses a specific concern for Singapore, the platform can be implemented across geographies and target various vulnerable industries.

An MVP was rolled out in Singapore during its Circuit Breaker period in March 2020, gaining over a hundred organically driven entries. Created in collaboration with [Stacey Yip](https://www.staceyip.com/).
