In the summer of 2019, I had the pleasure to work as a STEP Intern at Google Singapore. I was part of the Research and Machine Intelligence team, working on on-device machine intelligence.

During my time there, I worked on crafting an end-to-end product including: implementing an on-device data collection pipeline, data analysis using TensorFlow-Lite, and creating an Android application to display the data in a meaningful visual manner to aid data exploration.

Throughout the internship I worked with various stakeholders: a UX designer to brainstorm and craft the data visualisation UI, and other team members to discuss the architecture of the app. I had also worked with an API that was still in development, and so had to collaborate closely with people from other offices.

Other activities included: an intern yacht party(!!), building up ML knowledge by taking the [ML Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/ml-intro), weekly book club sessions reading the [DeepLearningBook](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/), an intern trip to Langkawi, and lots of rock climbing sessions at the office climbing gym.

Special thanks to Cristen and Aaron for being such amazing hosts and co-hosts, and for being so patient with my questions.
