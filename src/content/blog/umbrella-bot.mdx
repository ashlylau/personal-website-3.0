This telegram bot does exactly what it says it does, it reminds you to bring an umbrella if it's going to rain that day.

You can `/subscribe` for daily weather and covid updates, as well as get it to give you random facts (did you know that a giraffe has the same number of bones in its neck as a human?!)

I'm not too sure if the bot still works, but its worth a shot: https://telegram.me/umbrella_test_bot.
