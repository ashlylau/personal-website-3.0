Stacey and I hosted a powerpoint presentation party!! 
The image above was the invite for the event, which we haphazardly put together with a combination of actual google slides and the ARC browser canvas.

One thing we wanted from curating the guest list was that no one should know each other from before. Everyone also had to prepare a presentation.
Somehow, _people showed up_! We had some food and got treated to many great presentations:
- a personal eat pray love experience
- collectible shoes
- singaporean animals dance off
- dance journey
- [2023 year in review](/blog/2023-year-in-review)
- that time I went solo
- PEOPLE I WANT TO FIGHT EVEN THOUGH I'M SERIOUSLY UNFIT AND CAN'T FIGHT
- having chickens as pets


I realise now that this was quite a demanding ask from my friends and I'm eternally grateful for everyone who showed up :)

PS -- I brought my projector screen to MVRCK for this event and that screen is still there (it is now 2025)
