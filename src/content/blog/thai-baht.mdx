People keep asking me why I have a Thai Baht note in my phone case. For context, I have a clear phone case for my iPhone, and there's a bunch of stickers in there / receipts / tickets that basically obscure the blue phone body altogether. So I didn't think it was that big a deal, I had put the note in there when we were planning to climb Fun Dee back in July. I had wanted to have some emergency cash with me but didn't want to pack my wallet.

Turns out, that Thai Baht note residing my phone case is a very good conversation starter, especially from people I don't actually talk to that often. My close friends have never once brought it up.

My answer to the query is always kinda boring and usually ends the conversation right there. I'll keep it in my phone case and maybe come up with some more elaborate story next time.
