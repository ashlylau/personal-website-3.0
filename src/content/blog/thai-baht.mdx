People keep asking me why I have a Thai Baht note in my phone case. I didn't think it was that big a deal, I had put the note in there when we were planning to climb [Fun Dee](https://www.thecrag.com/en/climbing/thailand/krabi/route/9489822705) back in July -- I wanted some emergency cash on me but was lazy to pack my wallet.

Turns out, its actually a pretty good conversation starter, especially from people I don't talk to that often. My close friends have not once brought it up.

My answer to their questions are always kinda boring and usually ends the conversation right there, but I'll keep it in my phone case and maybe come up with some more elaborate story next time.
