People keep asking me why I have a Thai Baht note in my phone case. I didn't think it was that big a deal, I had put the note in there when we were planning to climb [Fun Dee](https://www.thecrag.com/en/climbing/thailand/krabi/route/9489822705) back in July -- I had wanted to have some emergency cash with me but didn't want to pack my wallet.

Turns out, that Thai Baht note residing my phone case is a very good conversation starter, especially from people I don't actually talk to that often. My close friends actually have never once brought it up.

My answer to the questions are always kinda boring and usually ends the conversation right there, but I'll keep it in my phone case and maybe come up with some more elaborate story next time.
