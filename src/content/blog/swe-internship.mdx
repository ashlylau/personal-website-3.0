I interned in the [Google Pay](https://pay.google.com/intl/en_in/about/) Growth Team from May to October 2020. During this internship, I worked on several projects:
- Project 1: Fine-grained Flare animation controls in Flutter
- Project 2: Streamlined onboarding flow of GPay app, which saved 10s of the onboarding user journey 
- Project 3: Campaign incentives auto-optimisations

A stand out project I worked on was the server implementation of a new onboarding feature in the Google Pay app. This feature saved **9 seconds** off the app's onboarding time, and was fully launched to production users! 
The work involved writing a new RPC and refactoring the existing one to fit into the new onboarding flow, as well as working with various different stakeholders.

Because of COVID, this internship was entirely remote :") The internship team still did an incredible job, with terrarium and coaster making workshops and even a virtual amazing race!

Am very grateful to my hosts Nuwan and Chun Mun, and everyone who helped make this internship such a great learning experience!
