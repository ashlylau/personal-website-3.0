"How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives" - Annie Dillard

I had started logging my activities in 2023 as a way to force myself to
remember what I had done in the week, because weeks fly so inconsequentially and
soon you realise that whole year actually comprises of just 52 of them.
Towards the end of the year I realised I had so much data about my self and 
how I spend my time, that it would be interesting to analyse.

Here's a presentation I made for [sipsomesoup powerpoint presentation party](/blog/sipsomesoup):

<div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 0; padding-top: 56.2500%;
 padding-bottom: 0; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px 0 rgba(63,69,81,0.16); margin-top: 1.6em; margin-bottom: 0.9em; overflow: hidden;
 border-radius: 8px; will-change: transform;">
  <iframe loading="lazy" style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; top: 0; left: 0; border: none; padding: 0;margin: 0;"

Some key learnings:
- I spent a bunch of time with friends this year! Made new friends, built deeper friendships and I feel very lucky.
- Had a bunch of travel.
- I'm still eternally grateful for movies.
- And music! Actually discovered what it was like to feel the lyrics of songs this year and it was eye opening.
- I watched 100 movies in 2023, which means I spent 3.4% of the year watching a movie.
- Started reading more books (27 this year). I used to think that reading was just for purposes of gaining knowledge and so it felt somewhat like a chore, but I've since rediscovered my love for fiction.
- I always seem to think that outside of work there's quite little time to do anything else. But actually, work and sleep only take up slightly over 50% of the year. Which is actually a lot of time leftover to do so many other things!!!
